Greetings! My name is Zixuan Su(蘇梓暄) and I'm currently a master student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong. Prior to CityUHK, I have worked on mathematical optimization, reconfigurable antenna and topology optimization with [Assoc. Prof.Ziheng Zhou](http://itlab.fzu.edu.cn/gzl/ZhuanJi/TeacherInfo2.aspx?No=T22108) and [Prof.Zhizhang(David) Chen(IEEE Fellow)](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/electrical/faculty-staff/our-faculty/professors/chen-zhizhang.html)

🔬Research Interests
======
- Reconfigurable Antenna Design
- Mathematical Optimization
- Applied Machine Learning

My current research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the Mechine Learning and its application in Recaonfigurable Antenna Design. 

In a word, advanced technologies like ML and Reconfigurable Antenna Design positively influence the life of everybody. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussinos and collaborations. Feel free to reach out me :D

📸Fun Facts
======
I have some hobbies that balance my life, starting with photography where I love capturing both the beauty of nature and the essence of people. I also enjoy the dynamic process of creating vlogs, which lets me document my adventures and share them with others.Watching anime is another hobby that has been with me since my childhood. I'm particularly fond of 'One Piece' and 'Naruto,' series that have captivated me with their high-energy adventures, heartfelt depictions of friendship, and profound life lessons.Additionally, I have a keen interest in painting, since it allows me to give free rein to my imagination, bringing to life the most whimsical ideas that dance in my mind.
