Greetings! My name is Zixuan Su(蘇梓暄) and I'm currently a master student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong. Prior to CityUHK, I have worked on mathematical optimization, reconfigurable antenna and topology optimization with [Assoc. Prof.Ziheng Zhou](http://itlab.fzu.edu.cn/gzl/ZhuanJi/TeacherInfo2.aspx?No=T22108) and [Prof.Zhizhang(David) Chen(IEEE Fellow)](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/electrical/faculty-staff/our-faculty/professors/chen-zhizhang.html)

🔬Research Interests
======
- Reconfigurable Antenna Design
- Mathematical Optimization
- Applied Machine Learning

My current research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the Mechine Learning and its application in Recaonfigurable Antenna Design. 

In a word, advanced technologies like ML and Reconfigurable Antenna Design positively influence the life of everybody. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussinos and collaborations. Feel free to reach out me :D

📸Fun Facts
======
I enjoy photography, capturing nature's splendor and people's essence. Creating vlogs lets me document and share my life's adventures. I've been an anime fan since childhood, especially loving the dynamic and emotional stories of 'One Piece' and 'Naruto'. I also love painting, which gives me the freedom to explore my imagination and create art from my thoughts.
