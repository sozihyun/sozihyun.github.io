Publications
======
1. Ziheng Zhou, Zixuan Su, and Zhizhang (David) Chen, et al, “Antenna Matching Network Topology Optimization: Theoretical Modeling and Numerical Experiments”, Experimental Technology and Management(a core Chinese Journal), Aug. 2024. (Accepted)
•Improving the radiation performance of antennas through the topology optimization of antenna matching networks: it first theoretically models the response of the antenna matching network using the impedance matrix method, and then uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the topology of the network, achieving intelligent on-demand design of the antenna working band.
2. Ziheng Zhou, Zixuan Su, and Zhizhang (David) Chen, “Waveguide-emulated index-near-zero media for antenna applications”, 2024 International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT), Beijing, China, May. 2024. (Invited talk) 
•Introducing the emerging waveguide-emulate index-near-zero (INZ) artificial media into novel INZ antenna designs.

  
Projects
======
Inverse Design of Dipole Antennas Based on Model Enhanced Supervised Descent Method			    08/2023-12/2023
•Represented as a topological network structure in the forward model of dipole antennas design, with a manipulable parameter matrix to enable resonant frequency switching.
•Implemented the Supervised Descent Method as a prior condition and enhanced it with the Gauss-Newton Method as a physical model in order to track optimization progress at each stage. 
•Compared their performance against Genetic Algorithms and Backpropagation (BP) neural networks. 
Zip code and Noise-laden Digital Captcha Recognition by BP Neural Networks   				    05/2023-07/2023
•Trained BP neural networks using the MNIST and printed database through MATLAB, and analyzed the network accuracy.
•Compared with image processing techniques to successfully implement accurate recognition of Zip code and noised digital CAPTCHA code using trained network, exported the function that filters and outputs corresponding provinces on Zip code.
